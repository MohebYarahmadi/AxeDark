## A dark theme for vscode

I love to program and I program in defferent languages, I always suffering with color themes that works on a specific language but not in another so I decided to make my own theme which is readable and beautifull. I love Ayu but not it's syntax color and I love visual studio 2019 syntax color, so I mixed theme up and create my own.
It suit your eyes in daytime and night and you don't need to change your theme. it won't  make you confuse in reading your code an makes it more readable. I hope you enjoy.

font: JetBrains Mono
file icon: field lights monochromatic
